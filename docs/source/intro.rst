Welcome To quickBayes
=====================

The quickBayes package is an open source library for calculating a fast approximation of the Bayesian evidence for use in model selection.
The package is cross platform, supporting Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
This package has been developed by Anthony Lim from STFC’s ISIS Neutron and Muon facility.

The quickBayes package was originally designed as a successor to the quasielasticbayes package.
However, quickBayes has abstracted the key ideas to make a more generic package.

In science hypotheses are tested against data, to determine the underlying behavior of the system.
These hypotheses can be in the form of a mathematical expression that originates from first principles (i.e. it has been derived) or is an approximation to other more complex mechanisms (e.g. semi-empirical methods).
The quickBayes package is designed to test these hypotheses against the user’s data to identify the most likely.
For example, in Quasi Elastic Neutron Scattering (QENS) the data can be represented by a summation of Lorentzian peaks (convoluted with a resolution function, see  the QENS example :ref:`here <examples>` for more detail), but the number of peaks is not obvious as shown below.

The quickBayes packages is designed to make these decisions easier by calculating the probability of one, two or three peaks given the data.
