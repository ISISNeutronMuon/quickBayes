    "In this example we will look at some simulated muon spectroscopy data. This data has been used at the ISIS Neutron and Muon source to test software. The simulated data is described by a background plus some exponential decays. The decay constants can indicate the muon stopping site or the relaxation time for the muon, depending on the experimental setup. There can be multiple muon stopping sites or relaxation times within a sample, so it is important to be able to identify the number of exponential decays. \n",
